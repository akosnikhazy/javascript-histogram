	This is a very old script of mine I modified to put it on github
	It shows proper histogram, but has its problems. Especially the rate
	thing. What I changed is, it is now possible to use different size
	and aspect ratio for the histogram so it is more dynamic like that.

			<h1>Canvas Histogram</h1>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p>This is a very basic and far from perfect canvas color / brightness histogram script that I stopped developing because I just wanted to see the concept working. It needs a lot of development; this is just a scratch. I put some test images in it so you can see it working. 
			<br><br>Things to do:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Better algorithm</li>
				<li>Code optimisation</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Tests</h2>
		<span id="one">Test 1</span>, <span id="two">Test 2</span>, <span id="three">Test 3</span><br>Note: Test 3 is a fully b&w images so all red, green and blue values are the same. You see only the blue because that is the last value drawn so it hides the others.<p></p>
